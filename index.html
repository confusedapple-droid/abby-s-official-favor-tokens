  <h1>💌 A Message for You</h1>
  
 <p>
Hey there, person I met online. 💫<br><br>

I want to wish you a <strong>Happy Birthdayyyy!!!</strong> 🎉🎂<br>
I hope you have—or had—a fun day. It’s <em>your</em> day, so you better have 🔪😄<br><br>

So anyway… I made you a gift.  
I didn’t really know what to give someone who can have anything they want,  
so yeah—I made you <em>this</em>.  
I hope you enjoy it, or at least appreciate it.  
I hope this makes you happy. 💗<br><br>

Remember: you deserve more in life than just the bare minimum ahhahah.  
I hope you always remember that you are great, and that you have a gift—  
a gift of making people feel comfortable and jolly,  
which honestly made me enjoy our conversations a lot. 😊<br><br>

I also hope you keep that happiness in your life,  
no matter how big or small the things you face or do.  
Whenever you feel lonely or sad, I hope this small gift reminds you  
that you are never truly alone.  
You have your friends, your family, and people around you  
who want to uplift you. 🌈<br><br>

Remember that in life, rain happens too—  
but the sun always shines again. ☀️🌧️<br><br>

Thank you for being a friend, and a good happy crush to me hahahah.  
Thank you for being there when I was lost  
and for helping me realize the things I was missing in life.  
You were such an incredible person that instead of pursuing you,  
I started working on myself hahahah.  
Thank you for being that way. ✨<br><br>

If one day we never hear from each other again,  
be happy. Take care of yourself.  
Drink water. Eat healthy.  
And achieve everything you’ve ever wanted in life. 💪💖<br><br>

I wanted to give back to you with this gift—  
<strong>made from scripts and strings</strong>.  
So if you ever need a favor, use it or not, your call. just tell me and click the boxes.  
Whether it’s ranting, sharing stories, or asking questions about life,  
I’ll do the best I can to be there for you. 🤍<br><br>

We may never grow old together,  
but at least—you never grew old to me.  
Thank you for sharing your light.  
Thank you for helping me find that fire again,  
that spark that made me move forward once more. 🔥✨<br><br>

Anyway… enjoy your day!!! 🎈  
Thank you, Abby. 💕<br><br>
